GENN
----
GENN is a general neural network that is designed to train on any data. Consult the article describing its uses or give a '-h' option for some help. An example of a database on which GENN was trained to predict ASA is given in GENN/example. The file genn.in is the general input file and the database db/ contains a sample of 100 proteins from the proteins used to train ASAquick. A simple command line to preform the training is

genn2wind.e -l genn.in

This will generate a weights file that can be used for prediction with either -pr1 or -prl options. Manipulation of the neural network parameters occurs through the command line, run

genn2wind.e -h to see the options available.


ENJOY!!!
